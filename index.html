                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Idea:</b> Casino Simulator </li>
                    <li> <b>Summary:</b> In this entirely HTML/CSS casino (cssino ðŸ¤­), the player navigates through menus and games with their mouse and experiences some of the thrill of a real casino! </li>
                    <li> <b>Technologies & Techniques:</b> As stated, everything is written entirely in CSS and HTML. Since there is no logic in these languages, there had to be many creative workarounds. <ul>
                        <li> <b> Slots:</b> In the slots game, I implemented pseudo randomization and animation control by having the 'PLAY' button on the slot machine seamlessly contain 2 seperate hyperlinks, one winning animation on a new page, one losing animation on the other, depending on where the player clicks. The slots themselves were tables with a translation animation, each set independently. I also used keyframes and scaling to allow for animations and interaction, resulting in a more fleshed out and immersive expirience.</li>
                        <li> <b> Title Screen:</b> In the title screen, I used keyframes and text settings in CSS to make an imitation neon sign. </li>
                        <li> <b> Main Screen:</b> In the main screen, I used a map over the background picture to allow the user to simply click on the game they wanted to play. </li>
                        <li> <b> Exit Screen:</b> In the exit screen, I used keyframes and scaling to make an animation represeting the printing of a cashout voucher.  </li>
